Stripe Payment Form
====================================
This is a simple stripe payment form built with HTML and PHP. This form uses
the stripe API to allow you to accept card payments on your website. All you need
to get started are your Stripe API keys which can be found at: https://dashboard.stripe.com/account/apikeys
This repository includes the stripe library so NO OTHER INSTALLATION is required. You MUST
have an SSL certificate. This is a huge security risk implementing otherwise.
I enjoy making software so much! Please, if you see any issues make them known!
